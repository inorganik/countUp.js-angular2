# CountUp.js Angular ^2 Module

This is an Angular directive wrapper around the core functionality of CountUp which is maintained in the [CountUp.js repo](https://github.com/inorganik/countUp.js). MIT License.

#### [CountUp.js demo](http://inorganik.github.io/countUp.js)
Or see this angular version work by cloning this project and running `ng serve`.

## Usage

Install the package in your project:

`yarn add countup.js-angular2` or `npm i countup.js-angular2`

In `app.module.ts`, import the module:
```ts
import { CountUpModule } from 'countup.js-angular2';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...
    CountUpModule
  ],
  ...
})
```

Use it in your markup. Since it's a directive, it can be added to any element:
```html
<h1 [countUp]="345" (complete)="doSomethingOnComplete()">0</h1>
```

See below for additional [Ionic 4 usage instructions](#ionic-4-usage).

#### Defer animation
Bind the endVal to some property. Leave it undefined and the animation won't start until `endVal` has a value.
```html
<h1 [countUp]="myEndVal" [options]="myOpts">0</h1>
```

Inputs:
- `countUp`: number to count to
- `options`: [CountUpOptions](https://github.com/inorganik/countUp.js#options) - fine-grain control over CountUp
- `reanimateOnClick`: pass false to disable (defaults to true)

Outputs:
- `complete`: emits when the animation completes

#### Ionic 4 usage

Ionic 4 uses lazy loading. This means that each page is also a module.

If you are using it with Ionic Framework you will need to import the module at the page level as well. 

Follow the [usage guide](#usage) above, and then in `(pagename).module.ts`, also import the module:
```ts
import { CountUpModule } from 'countup.js-angular2';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...
    CountUpModule
  ],
  ...
})
```

## Testing

The test app in this repo has a passing test for a component that uses the CountUp directive, which you can use as an example.  If your component uses the CountUp directive, include the CountUpModule in your TestBed:

```
beforeEach(async(() => {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    imports: [
      CountUpModule,
      ...
    ],
    ...
  })
});
```

For Jest, I used [jest-preset-angular](https://github.com/thymikee/jest-preset-angular). Make sure you have the following in your jest.config.js:

```
transform: {
  '^.+\\.(js|ts|tsx)$': 'ts-jest'
},
transformIgnorePatterns: ['node_modules/(?!countup.js)']
```
And make sure you add this under `compilerOptions` in your root tsconfig.json:
```
"allowJs": true,
```

Before you make a pull request, please follow these instructions:

1. Make your edits to `./projects/count-up/src/lib/count-up.directive.ts`.
1. Run `ng s` and test your changes in the demo app.

Publishing (you don't need to do this, it&rsquo;s for my own reference):

1. Increment the version number if necessary (and `install-tarball` script).
1. Commit changes.
1. Run `yarn package:countup` which builds and packs a tarball.
1. Install the tarball in the test app: `yarn install-tarball`.
1. Make app.module import from newly installed package.
1. Run the test app with AOT compiler and make sure the demo works: `ng serve --prod`.
1. Run `npm publish dist/count-up`
1. Discard changes.
